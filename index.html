        Can we see the Great Wall<br>
        of China from space?

    <div class="h2">
        The Great Wall of China can be seen from space with the <br>
        help of special cameras and lenses. The Great Wall, like <br>
        many other structures, is also visible when a shuttle is a <br>
        few hundred kilometers away from the Earth’s surface.

    The Berlin Wall, built <br>
    by the Communists in 1961, <br>
    divided East and West Berlin. When <br>
    the gates to the wall were opened in <br>
    1989, ecstatic crowds from both <br>
    East and West Germany tore <br>
    down the wall.

    Why was Hadrian’s <br>
    Wall built?
</div>
<div class="h5">
    Hadrian’s Wall, located in England, was built by <br>
    Roman Emperor Hadrian in the years ad 122–130. It is <br>
    believed that the wall was built to keep enemies of the <br>
    Roman Empire out of Britain. The wall also acted as a <br>
    checkpoint for traders who traveled across the borders <br>
    to conduct business, helping the emperor to collect <br>
    taxes and prevent the smuggling of goods.

<div class="h25">
    That's Amazing!

    The Great Wall <br>
of China is a collection <br>
of walls built over a period <br>
of 2,000 years by different <br>
rulers. In 220 bc, Emperor Qin <br>
Shihuangdi connected the <br>
different pieces to protect <br>
his empire from the Huns <br>
and Mongols.

    What is the traditional name <br> 
of the Great Wall of China? <br>
What does it mean when <br>
translated into English? <br>
</div>
<div class="h9">
    Hadrian’s Wall, <br>
stretching from the North <br>
Sea to the Irish Sea, was <br>
117.5 km long. Today, many of the <br>
stones have been taken away and <br>
used in newer buildings.
</div>
<div class="h10">
    The splendor of the <br>
Great Wall of China lies in its <br>
continuity. Increasing tourism <br>
and illegal development have <br>
destroyed two-thirds of the wall, <br>
leaving large holes in this <br>
grand structure.

    Visitors often litter <br>
the track on their <br>
visit to the Great Wall <br>
of China. Take some <br>
recyclable objects and <br>
make your own Great <br>
Wall of China.

    When attacked <br>
by enemies, soldiers on outposts communicated with <br>
each other through smoke signals <br>
during the day and bonfires at night. Each outpost was stocked with <br>
enough supplies to withstand a siege of four months.
